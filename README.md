# What is Plcat
Plcat is a software application that allows you to merge multiple playlists in your Spotify account into a single new playlist. It is designed to simplify the process of creating a new playlist that combines your favorite tracks from multiple playlists.

With Plcat, you can select the playlists you want to merge, and then choose a name and description for your new playlist. You can also decide whether to make the new playlist public or private. Once you've finished creating the playlist in Plcat, the program will automatically create the playlist in your Spotify account with the selected tracks from the playlists you chose.

Plcat is a useful tool for anyone who loves music and wants to create new playlists that combine their favorite tracks from different playlists. It is easy to use and can save you a lot of time and effort compared to manually creating a new playlist by copying and pasting tracks from multiple playlists.

## How to use Plcat
When you land on the page, you'll see a button to authorize with Spotify. If you've authorized before, you'll be automatically taken to the playlist creator.

Once you've authorized, you'll be redirected to the playlist creator. Here, you'll see a list of all your playlists. To merge playlists, simply select the ones you want by clicking on them. The selected playlists will turn white.

When you're done selecting playlists, click the "create" button. You'll be redirected to the creator page where you can edit the details for your new playlist. Once you're happy with the details, click "create" again to finish the process.

And that's it! You've successfully merged your playlists.
